## Overview

The Solidity by Example ERC20 contract is a basic implementation of the ERC20 token standard. This contract allows for the creation and management of a fungible token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Token Details

- **Name:** Solidity by Example
- **Symbol:** SOLBYEX
- **Decimals:** 18

## Smart Contract Functions

### `transfer(address recipient, uint amount) external returns (bool)`

The `transfer` function allows token holders to transfer tokens to another address. It updates the sender's and recipient's balances and emits a `Transfer` event.

### `approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool)`

The `approve` function enables token holders to grant approval to a spender to transfer a specific amount of tokens on their behalf. It updates the allowance mapping and emits an `Approval` event.

### `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint amount) external returns (bool)`

The `transferFrom` function allows a spender (with approval) to transfer tokens from the sender's address to another address. It updates the sender's and recipient's balances, as well as the allowance mapping, and emits a `Transfer` event.

### `mint(uint amount) external`

The `mint` function allows the contract owner to mint additional tokens. It increases the total supply and updates the balance of the owner, emitting a `Transfer` event.

### `burn(uint amount) external`

The `burn` function allows token holders to burn a specific amount of their tokens. It decreases the total supply and updates the balance of the burner, emitting a `Transfer` event.

## Events

- `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value)`: Emitted when tokens are transferred from one address to another.
- `Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint value)`: Emitted when approval is granted for a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of an owner.
